# Information Value and Weight Of Evidence in Python

Attribute relevance analysis **helps in recognizing the most important variables which have the greatest impact on 
target variable** and understanding relations and logic between the most important predictors and the target variable.

Information value (IV) and weight of evidence (WOE) are simple and powerful techniques of conducting attribute
relevance analysis. They provide a great framework for exploratory analysis and have been used extensively in the credit
risk world for several decades.

This library was built to simplify and automate the process of calculating and interpreting IV and WOE.

## Installation

Install the library by running this code:
```bash
# it's nice to start with creating a virtual environment (but is not required).
python -m venv my_env

pip install git+https://github.com/krzdur/iv-and-woe-python.git
```

## Use cases
A few examples of usage of the library have been provided in the **[examples](https://github.com/krzdur/iv-and-woe-python/tree/master/examples)**.
